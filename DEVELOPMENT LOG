TEAM MEMBERS: LUIS FERNANDO VILLASEÑOR GARCÍA & JORGE ANTONIO MALDONADO NUÑEZ

Development of the project started on wednesday 8th of 2021. On this day, Luis and Jorge both decided that the theme should be about surreal painter Rene Magritte and together
chose 8 of his artworks.
Luis started the project that day, he set it up and started the basic outline not only for the organization of the websites files, 
but also for its visual elements. 
On saturday 11th, he and Jorge continued the project by deciding on how the main page should work, and then coded it. Jorge designed some of the classes that we used in our css file
while Luis added the initial bootstrap elements, like the stylesheets
and the grid. He then started customizing it, by choosing width and color scheme, for example. While he designed the main webpage, Jorge started to design how the page for each
image should look and work. We had problems with the grid for a while but after some tampering with our code
On sunday 12th of september of 2021, Jorge and Luis continued to code the project, while Jorge fixed some minor issues with the design (separation between images, padding, etc.)
Luis wrote the descriptions for each of the pages. They both decided on the two fonts used in the projects.
At the end of that same day we decided that we were satisfied with the visual elements, the functionality and the overall feel of the website and decided to upload it to GitHub.
After watching a short video Luis learned how to download GitHub, how to use it and uploaded the project and wrote the development log that you are reading now.
